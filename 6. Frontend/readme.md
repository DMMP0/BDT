# Frontend Layer

The aim of this layer is to display the records of the enter fiscal code in the text box

***NB: this layer was designed with Python 3.10 in mind.***

**In order for the script to work, a json credential file must be present into the "credentials" folder.**
The credential path can be changed at the start of each service file of the Query layer:

*config_db = json.load(open(source + "/credentials/db-config.json"))*

***NB: how to start:*** In order to run this, we have to call the main.py in components. The server for the anvil app will be started and now you can use this app anywhere to want on the web browser
